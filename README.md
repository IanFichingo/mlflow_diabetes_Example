# Demonstrating Mlflow using simple Linear Regression

Mlflow is a toolkit used to track, store, monitor machine learning models. It is used throughout the machine learning lifecycle. In this example we demonstrate the use of mlflow using linear regression model. This is an introduction to mlflow. We only use two commands that is mlflow.autolog() and mlflow.ui. We use the sklearn diabetes dataset to do this. I'm trying to get my hands on MLOPs. For me am still learning and I welcome any suggestions and corrections.

The code is written in a jupyter notebook. However the command mflow.ui is used in the commandline. The command is used to compare your models or experiments.
