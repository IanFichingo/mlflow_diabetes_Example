# Demonstrating Mlflow using simple Linear Regression

Mlflow is a toolkit used to track, store, monitor machine learning models. It is used throughout the machine learning lifecycle. In this example we demonstrate the use of mlflow using linear regression model. This is an introduction to mlflow. We only use two commands that is - and - . We use the sklearn diabetes dataset to do this. I'm trying to get my hands on MLOPs. For me am still learning and I welcome any suggestions and corrections.
